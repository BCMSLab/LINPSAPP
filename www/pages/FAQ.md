### What can this app be used for?

The app can be used to screen for cell specific perturbations (drugs, gene manipulation) that significantly affect networks of several cancer processes.

### What analysis is this database used for?

This database is built using two main datasets. First, the The Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures (LINCS) dataset to model the effect of the perturbations on gene expression of cancer cell lines. Second, several causal biological networks (CBN) which are a collection of curated interactions of biological entities in several different biological processes.

### What downstream analysis can be used with the output from this app?

(Not answered)

### What to do if the cells/perturbation/processes I am interested in are not included?

(Not answered)
