- Cell
    - Tissue: the tissue name of the cell lines (e.g. Skin, Lung, Kidney, Liver, etc)
    - Cell line: the official name of the cell line (e.g. A375, A54, HA1E, HEPG2, etc)
- Network
    - Family: networks are grouped into biger categories such as Cell Proliferation (CPR), Inflammatory Process (IPN), etc
    - Model: the name of the network (e.g. Cell Cycle, Epithelial Innate Immune Activation, etc)
- Perturbation
    - Type: the type of perturbations include things such as trt_cp (compound), trt_sh (shRHNA), etc
    - Name: the name of the particular perturbation drugs in the case of trt_cp or genes symbols otherwise
